#### TO-DO

### I. Header

1. The header component contains the application's logo on the left side, which is clickable and points to the product list page
2. The header component contains the application's cart widget
3. The header component supports certain degree of opacity, which adds up to the look and feel of the app and also allows better visibility for the users

### II. Product List page

1. The product list page lists all available products, displaying each product's thumbnail image, title, price (formatted as GBP) and a button for adding it to the cart
2. The product list page is usable on both desktop and mobile devices, whereas on desktop it leverages three items per row grid, on mobile view is two or one, depending on the viewport width
